        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          With a strong background in marketing, I've been passionate about
          training and empowering aspiring marketers for the past 8 years.

          I have designed and delivered comprehensive digital marketing
          frameworks and courses for enthusiastic apprentices and students
          throughout the UK and have empowered newcomers to the digital world
          and helped them maximise the exciting opportunities available.

          My interest in web development began during my university days, where
          I built blogs using WordPress.com. Since then, I have worked with
          various Content Management Systems such as Squarespace, WIX, and
          Webflow.

          This sparked my curiosity about the technologies behind those CMS
          platforms and how they functioned. While running a Limited company in
          digital recruitment, I witnessed the immense power and potential of
          web development and the tech industry as a whole.

          Inspired by this realisation, I embarked on a self-taught journey to
          become a front-end web developer. In addition to expanding my
          front-end skills, I actively engage with a growing community on
          LinkedIn, emphasising the significance of digital portfolios.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I offered my services to aspiring marketers and junior front-end
          developers, helping them create impactful digital portfolios that can
          enhance their job prospects. Today? I can't wait to start a new career
          in tech. Thanks for reading.
